Statistical Analysis

Step-by-step process
Import and clean data
	Remove columns with high amount of null values
	Look into columns with low variance		
	Look into columns with very few unique values

Data statistical analysis
	Use Seaborn pairplot to look at visual representations of overall dataframe correlation
	Calculate overall dataframe correlation (numerical variables)
	Sort numerical independent variables in terms of correlation with SalePrice
	Perform simple OLS linear regression on top 6 numerical independent variables
	Plot data with linear regression line

Which categorical factors are most likely to affect the sale price?
	MSSubClass (16 cats)
	MSZoning (8 cats)
	Neighborhood (25 cats)
	BldgType (5 cats)
	HouseStyle (8 cats)
	SaleType (10 cats)
	SaleCondition (6 cats)

Perform multiple OLS linear regression on Neighborhoods

Which variables are measured by square feetâ€¦..
	LotArea
	TotalBsmtSF
	1stFlrSF
	2ndFlrSF
	GrLivArea
	GarageArea
	WoodDeckSF
	OpenPorchSF
	CombinedIntPorch

Perform multiple OLS linear regression on these variables

Future improvements
	Remove outliers prior to analysis
	Look at number/type of rooms above basement
	Look at year/month of sale (Time Series)
